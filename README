This little tool runs a process with a temporary /tmp mount that goes away as soon as the process exits. This is originally developed to handle builds/tools that clutter /tmp.

Run this like "transienttmp COMMAND..." like "transienttmp ant test"

The executable needs to have the setuid bit set to perform mount
