This little tool runs a process with a temporary /tmp mount that goes away as soon as the process exits. This is originally developed to handle builds/tests that clutter /tmp.

This tool takes advantages of the per-process mount table available in modern Linux kernels. That is, the process launched through this command will see a different /tmp than the rest of the world sees.

Run this like "transienttmp COMMAND..." like "transienttmp ant test"

To install, "make install"
